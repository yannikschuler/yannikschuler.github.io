Hi! I am a [Walter Benjamin fellow](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) of the DFG working in [Rahul Pandharipande](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~rahul/)'s research group at ETH Zürich. Before that I was research associate in [Dhruv Ranganathan](https://www.dhruvrnathan.net/)'s group in Cambridge and did my PhD under the supervision of [Andrea Brini](https://andrea-brini.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/) in the [Algebraic Geometry and Mathematical Physics group](https://agmp.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/) in Sheffield.

My research focuses on questions about enumerative invariants and the geometry of their moduli spaces — mostly in the framework of Gromov–Witten theory. Often these questions are inspired by topological quantum field theories. For instance currently I am working on a mathematical formulation of the refined topological string which I expect will allow us to study topological M-theory indirectly.

I did my undergraduate studies in Bonn and wrote my Master thesis in Physics under the supervision of [Albrecht Klemm](https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/people/faculty/profile/albrecht-klemm/) and [Gaëtan Borot](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/forschungsgebiete/mathematische-physik/borot-mp-homepage).

My name is pronounced \[[ˈjanɪk](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/De-Yannick.ogg) [ˈʃyːlɐ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/De-Sch%C3%BCler.ogg)\].

Pronouns: he/him.
