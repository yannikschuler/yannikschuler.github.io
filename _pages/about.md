Hi! I am a third year PhD student under the supervision of [Andrea Brini](https://andrea-brini.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/) in the [Algebraic Geometry and Mathematical Physics](https://agmp.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/) research group at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). I will submit my thesis next spring and I will be a research associate in the group of [Dhruv Ranganathan](https://www.dhruvrnathan.net/) from March until August next year. Afterwards I will be joining [Rahul Pandharipande](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~rahul/)'s group as a postdoc for two years.

My research focuses questions about enumerative invariants and the geometry of their moduli spaces — mostly in the framework of Gromov–Witten theory. Often these questions are inspired by topological quantum field theories. For instance currently I am working on a mathematical formulation of the refined topological string which I expect will allow us to study topological M-theory indirectly.

I did my undergraduate studies in Bonn and wrote my Master thesis in Physics under the supervision of [Albrecht Klemm](https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/people/faculty/profile/albrecht-klemm/) and [Gaëtan Borot](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/forschungsgebiete/mathematische-physik/borot-mp-homepage).
