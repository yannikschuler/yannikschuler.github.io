Hi! I am a third year PhD student under the supervision of [Andrea Brini](https://andrea-brini.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/) in the [Algebraic Geometry and Mathematical Physics](https://agmp.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/) research group at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). I will submit my thesis next spring before I will start a short postdoc position from March until September 2024 in the group of [Dhruv Ranganathan](https://www.dhruvrnathan.net/).

As a Mathematical Physicist my research lies at the intersection of Algebraic Geometry and Topological Quantum Field Theory. On the mathematical side it focuses on enumertive invariants and the geometry of their moduli spaces --- mostly Gromov--Witten theory. On the physics side I am trying to study topological M-theory through the refined topological string limit or better their anticipated mathematical counterparts.

I did my undergraduate studies in Bonn and wrote my Master thesis in Physics under the supervision of [Albrecht Klemm](https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/people/faculty/profile/albrecht-klemm/) and [GaÃ«tan Borot](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/forschungsgebiete/mathematische-physik/borot-mp-homepage).
