I am a third year PhD student under the supervision of <a href="https://andrea-brini.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Andrea Brini</a> in the <a href="https://agmp.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Algebraic Geometry and Mathematical Physics</a> research group at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Sheffield</a>. I will submit my thesis next spring and I will be a research associate in the group of <a href="https://www.dhruvrnathan.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dhruv Ranganathan</a> from March until August next year. Afterwards I will be joining <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~rahul/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rahul Pandharipande</a>’s group as a postdoc for two years.</p> <p>My research focuses questions about enumerative invariants and the geometry of their moduli spaces — mostly in the framework of Gromov–Witten theory. Often these questions are inspired by topological quantum field theories. For instance currently I am working on a mathematical formulation of the refined topological string which I expect will allow us to study topological M-theory indirectly.</p> <p>I did my undergraduate studies in Bonn and wrote my Master thesis in Physics under the supervision of <a href="https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/people/faculty/profile/albrecht-klemm/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Albrecht Klemm</a> and <a href="https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/forschungsgebiete/mathematische-physik/borot-mp-homepage" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gaëtan Borot</a>.</p> </body></html>
